How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I believe that the while there may not be any best way to 100% ensure my code, through proper practice of getting and designing the requirements document and testing teqniques
one could get very close to perfect. By using the requirements document as a baseline for design and for testing then at minimum the requirements will be 100% functional and secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs can be difficult due to lack of technical knowlege, how ever it should still be fairly easy to get a general idea of what solution would best fit the user
needs including what kinds of objects and object relationships will be needed.

How do I approach designing software?

I prefer to break it down into parts, and write most of my file at the same time and then test each method individually. This allows me to debug while I write my test for each method and 
end up with a pretty good test for each requirement, if not then I test for the requirments.
